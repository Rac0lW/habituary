## Features
- cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac OS)
- all data is stored as human-readable plain text
- four view modes: 1 day, 3 days, 5 days & 7 days
- move to-dos between days via simple drag & drop
- mark a to-do as a "Heading" to create (foldable) groups
- bookmark important to-dos for easy access from anywhere
- use the calendar widget to easily switch to far away dates
- responsive UI that adapts to the current window size

## Planned Features
_Roughly in that order. No promises made._

- spaced repetition to stay ontop of your capture
- undo/redo any changes you made
- keyboard-only control mode
- customizable key bindings
- customizable color theme
- recurring to-dos
